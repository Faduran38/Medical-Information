There are three files that I have provided. In the csv files there are hospital goals, which includes any financial 
goals that departments may have and there is hospital visits that are also provided that shpw date of admit, ID, doctor, 
hospital branch, department, patient name, risk profile, revenue, minutes to service and number of visits. In my powerpoint
of worksheets I provided 20 worksheets of different visualizations. In worksheet 1, I provided a dashboard of some hand chosen 
charts I wanted to use. In worksheet 2 I provided the number of patient visits in each department using a bar graph. In worksheet 2
I used a bullet chart to find the sum of revenue in each department. Worksheet 3 provides information on date of admit and the sum
of that date. Worksheet 4 provides information on the trend of number of patient visits in each month. Worksheet 5 uses a heat chart
to also identify that trend as well. Worksheet 7 tells us the sum of number of patient visits for each department type and the type of 
risk associated with it.
